Utilizing Firebase (Realtime Database and Authentication) and React JS, this is my idea for a social media platform built for developers, in which developers can publicize their ideas and formulate a team and a plan for progrress, in addition to connecting to other developers. 
Ideas:
- 'twitter' posting functionality but with added "I'm interested" button --> poster/interested people have the option of forming a team
- goal management functionality --> once teams are formed, have the ability to set deadline for goal, break into small checkmarkable tasks (similar to Trello)
- developer connecting functionality --> my idea was to use the dating app pictures 'swipe right/left' functionality for fun, except instead of attractive pictures developers include languages they wish to code in + skillsets they wish to develop
